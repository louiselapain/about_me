I have lived all my life in the same big blue house, on the main street in Essex. My father and mother, Christopher and Laurie, raised my siblings and I in a good Catholic house. I am the third youngest out of seven children; there is five girls and two boys. My older siblings are all married; Lauren (30), Mary (28), Mike (26), Martha (22). My younger siblings Therese (17) and John Paul (13), and I are the only ones left at home. I work at Dairy Freez in Cottom flipping burgers. When I am not working or at school I am either babysitting my nieces and nephews or playing hockey. This is a little bit of me.
